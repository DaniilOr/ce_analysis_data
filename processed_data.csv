2-6,,the circular economy is much more than a product recycling  while the substitution of secondary materials for primary materials can offer a partial solution to the problem of depletion of resources recycling offers limited appeal because its processes are energy intensive and in general degrade materials so that this leads to the continuous high demand for virgin materials thats what happens with paper or recycling paper  the circular economy goes beyond recycling since it is based on an industrial system of restoration oriented towards the design of waste for this reason the circular economy demands a greater energy contribution in the processes of repair reuse and remanufacturing the objective of the design of the products is not only that the design allows a better recovery at the end of the life of the product but that it reduces to a minimum the consumption of energy necessary for its recovery,positive,Quora,,,,"The Circular Economy is much<br>more than a product recycling<br>While the substitution of<br>secondary materials for<br>primary materials can offer a<br>partial solution to the<br>problem of depletion of<br>resources, recycling offers<br>limited appeal because its<br>processes are energy intensive<br>and, in general, degrade<br>materials, so that This leads<br>to the continuous high demand<br>for virgin materials.

Many<br>proponents of the circular<br>economy set nature as an<br>example. However, nature is<br>not perfect. The huge<br>complexity of ecosystems means<br>that a change in one variable<br>(say loss in biodiversity) can<br>create a cascade of effects<br>ending in the collapse of the<br>entire system. In the same<br>way, a cascade of events led<br>to the crash of the complex<br>and interlinked financial<br>system, which in turn affected<br>many others sectors. The<br>ramifications of a similar<br>crash in for instance<br>manufacturing would be<br>unpleasant at least."

Besides the lack<br>of awareness, resistance  to<br>change is a common<br>characteristic of the<br>construction industry (Lines<br>et al., 2015). According to<br>Interviewee G, construction<br>projects usually  have high<br>risk and low profit margins<br>involved, which is a scenario<br>that  tends to discourage the<br>adoption of new technologies,<br>and ways of  designing. As<br>pointed out by Acharya et al.<br>(2018), the built environment<br>is not conducive to a start-up<br>culture.

So it's going to<br>be a particular challenge for<br>the building industry to move<br>towards scope three reporting."
189-14,,its going to be a particular challenge for the building industry to move towards scope three reporting because the upstream and downstream elements of that are highly complex when it comes to this particular sector actually one point to touch upon there that thats them in terms of scope three thats where the circularity proposition is very powerfulthe  closer the product and the raw materials are in terms of supply chains in terms of locality the more transparency there is the easier it is to get um verified and auditable data from raw material to finished product to end of life so circularity is not just a fluffy notion it actually has very direct benefits in terms of scope  reporting and in terms of the size of the market,positive,Youtube,,,,it's going to be a particular<br>challenge for the building<br>industry to move towards scope<br>three reporting because the<br>upstream and downstream<br>elements of that are highly<br>complex.

There is the<br>easier it is to get um<br>verified and auditable data<br>from raw material to finished<br>product to end of life so<br>circularity is not just a<br>fluffy notion it actually has<br>very direct benefits in terms<br>of scope 3 reporting and in<br>terms of the size of the<br>market.
189-15,,obviously touched upon how much building there will be to quantify the demand for construction materials you can see here its going to be growing massively over the next few years and asia will comprise a lions share of demand for construction materials that means the problems i stated in terms of sand in terms of the carbon footprint of concrete is going to be a very real problem for the asia pacific region because it will see some of the largest increases in building stock and that means the largest consumption of the building materials and hence the largest consumption of the raw materials that form those um embodied carbon is going to be the next big challenge for the building industry and yeah and theyve been great strides in reducing operational carbon but not a great deal of progress towards reducing embodied carbon because it is a far more complex problem linked to the scope  comments i just made in terms of supply chains and raw materials,positive,Youtube,,,,Obviously touched upon how<br>much building there will be to<br>quantify the demand for<br>construction materials you can<br>see here.

189-16,,targets on that we then looked at other waste components that we can incorporate and that includes concrete waste and our own concrete waste in particular and we can incorporate glass waste as well and weve started testing with um cement substitutes locally sourced cement substitutes and thats and thats quite an important um point i want to stress in terms of cement alternatives um our focus on circularity so there are readily available cement alternatives such as pulverized fly ash from coal power plants or granulated blast slag from steel mills hong kong does not have those so we could import those and we would then compromise our circularity so what we do is focus on what is locally available and that will vary from market to market so we our solution is to find um alternatives for local waste not rely on transporting wastes across borders um to satisfy our our demands so our circularity is very very laser focused on what is locally available and can be locally utilized,positive,Youtube,,,,Targets on that we then looked<br>at other waste components that<br>we can incorporate and that<br>includes concrete waste and<br>our own concrete waste in<br>particular and we can<br>incorporate glass waste as<br>well and we've started testing<br>with um cement substitutes<br>locally sourced cement<br>substitutes and that's and<br>that's quite an important um<br>point I want to stress in<br>terms of cement Alternatives<br>um our focus on circularity so<br>there are readily available<br>cement Alternatives such as<br>pulverized fly ash from coal<br>power plants or granulated<br>blast slag from steel mills<br>Hong Kong does not have those<br>so we could import those and<br>we would then compromise our<br>circularity so what we do is<br>focus on what is locally<br>available and that will vary<br>from Market to Market so we<br>our solution is to find um<br>alternatives for local waste<br>not rely on transporting<br>wastes across borders um to<br>satisfy our our demands so our<br>circularity is very very laser<br>focused on what is locally<br>available and can be locally<br>utilized
189-17,,then i think in terms of the technical aspects obviously ill keep it high level for now but in terms of the technical aspects that we have satisfied and certified in hong kong weve satisfied all of the general specifications for civil engineering works which are the industry standards here in hong kong they are amongst the most stringent standards in asia and not have we met the minimum requirement weve actually achieved grade a classification which even for conventional concrete equivalents is quite hard to achieve and not all manufacturers can achieve that so weve achieved best in class classifications from a technical uh capacity which covers compressive strength abrasion resistance and dimensional deviations,positive,Youtube,,,,then I think in terms of the<br>technical aspects obviously<br>I'll keep it high level for<br>now but in terms of the<br>technical aspects that we have<br>satisfied and certified in<br>Hong Kong we've satisfied all<br>of the general specifications<br>for civil engineering Works<br>which are the industry<br>standards here in Hong Kong.<br>They are amongst the most<br>stringent standards in Asia<br>and not have we met the<br>minimum requirement we've<br>actually achieved grade A<br>classification which even for<br>conventional concrete<br>equivalents is quite hard to<br>achieve and not all<br>manufacturers can achieve that<br>so we've achieved Best in<br>Class classifications from a<br>technical uh capacity which<br>covers compressive strength<br>abrasion resistance and<br>dimensional deviations

195-4,,to actually deconstructing buildings as opposed to demolishing them and theres also a really big challenge around if we are to switch to deconstruction what are the costs associated with that and that can scare a lot of of clients um from you know choosing deconstruction over demolition um so yeah theres a its a really big subject but i think the key the key item is at the design stage so its what our engineers and architects and designers can do to change from the demolition to deconstruction and thats why we are here today to hopefully give the audience uh a little bit of an overview of what that can look like in in practice so what does better design for buildings look like and what specifically is design for the construction,positive,Youtube,,,,to actually deconstructing<br>buildings as opposed to<br>demolishing them and there's<br>also a really big challenge<br>around if we are to switch to<br>deconstruction what are the<br>costs associated with that and<br>that can scare a lot of of<br>clients um from you know<br>choosing deconstruction over<br>demolition um so yeah there's<br>a it's a really big subject<br>but i think the key the key<br>item is at the design stage so<br>it's what our engineers and<br>architects and designers can<br>do to change from the<br>demolition to deconstruction<br>and that's why we are here<br>today to hopefully give the<br>audience uh a little bit of an<br>overview of what that can look<br>like in in practice so what<br>does better design for<br>buildings look like and what<br>specifically is design for the<br>construction
195-5,,so design for deconstruction is a philosophy where buildings are designed intentionally for material recovery and reuse at the end of life so like i said currently buildings not only have zero value at the end of life they actually cost money to demolish and process the waste so instead when we design for deconstruction you have this fantastic ability to create buildings which act as these stockpiles of these valuable materials that can be easily taken apart and used in new buildings instead of virgin materials and in doing that helps us to sort of chip away at the enormous amount of carbon emissions which are associated with the build environment and in terms of actually doing this practically the deconstructed,positive,Youtube,,,,so design for deconstruction<br>is a philosophy where<br>buildings are designed<br>intentionally for material<br>recovery and reuse at the end<br>of life so like i said<br>currently buildings not only<br>have zero value at the end of<br>life they actually cost money<br>to demolish and process the<br>waste so instead when we<br>design for deconstruction you<br>have this fantastic ability to<br>create buildings which act as<br>these stockpiles of these<br>valuable materials that can be<br>easily taken apart and used in<br>new buildings instead of<br>virgin materials and in doing<br>that helps us to sort of chip<br>away at the enormous amount of<br>carbon emissions which are<br>associated with the build<br>environment and in terms of<br>actually doing this<br>practically the deconstructed
195-6,,like the ideal deconstructable building is very similar to a lego building so we try and design components that are modular connections that are reversible just like lego and materials that are robust and reusable and we want to try to avoid using any paints or coatings that might be difficult to remove and we want to ensure that the components of the building are easy to access and theres a plan for how they can sort of safely be removed without damaging the item and i mean you brought it this up in your firstanswer the importance of the design  stage and you know how much of our environmental impact is determined by decisions that we made in that crucial design stage and i mean obviously as you speak it comes to mind that one of the benefits is probably you know reducing the amount of waste that the builtin vitamin environment produces but what are other benefits that perhaps designing for the construction can have economic or environmental any kind of benefit,positive,Youtube,,,,"like the ideal deconstructable<br>building is very similar to a<br>lego building so we try and<br>design components that are<br>modular connections that are<br>reversible just like lego and<br>materials that are robust and<br>reusable and we want to try to<br>avoid using any paints or<br>coatings that might be<br>difficult to remove and we<br>want to ensure that the<br>components of the building are<br>easy to access and there's a<br>plan for how they can sort of<br>safely be removed without<br>damaging the item and i mean<br>you brought it this up in your<br>firstanswer the importance of<br>the design  stage and you know<br>how much of our environmental<br>impact is determined by<br>decisions that we made.

195-7,,sure so  of global carbon emissions is attributed to the carbon which is embodied in the materials that we use so in designing for deconstruction we are potentially opening up a stock of materials that can be reclaimed at the end of life and reused in new buildings which then in turn reduces the carbon emissions associated with new buildings and in terms of economic going for design for deconstruction one of the challenges thats often cited is the increased use of labor at the end of life to deconstruct in order to to unbolt everything rather than just go through it with an earth mover involves a lot more people but that is a real great opportunity for job creation as is you know refurbishment of things that come out of existing buildings for reclamation is also a really laborintensive process that that can create jobs in the local economy and grace you you work for arab and you obviously have a lot of experience working on the circular economy and and the built environment,positive,Youtube,,,,sure so 11 of global carbon<br>emissions is attributed to the<br>carbon which is embodied in<br>the materials that we use so<br>in designing for<br>deconstruction we are<br>potentially opening up a stock<br>of materials that can be<br>reclaimed at the end of life<br>and reused in new buildings<br>which then in turn reduces the<br>carbon emissions associated<br>with new buildings and in<br>terms of economic going for<br>design for deconstruction. one<br>of the challenges that's often<br>cited is the increased use of<br>labor at the end of life to<br>deconstruct in order to to<br>unbolt everything rather than<br>just go through it with an<br>earth mover involves a lot<br>more people but that is a real<br>great opportunity for job<br>creation as is you know<br>refurbishment of things that<br>come out of existing buildings<br>for reclamation is also a<br>really labor-intensive process<br>that that can create jobs in<br>the local economy and grace<br>you you work for arab and you<br>obviously have a lot of<br>experience working on the<br>circular economy and and the<br>built environment

195-9,,thats sort of the um insitu reuse story but the part of it that i find really interesting and different is that rather than replacing the facade which looked quite tired and perhaps dated what they did is they dismantled it um and transported around  square meters of it to a popup factory where each panel was inspected cleaned and had the gaskets replaced and then it was installed back on the building which resulted in a  saving in cost and even things like paving and other roof materials were reused products from other demolished building  this is a this is a great example of of dismantling in a building and and refurbishing and a great example of a circular economy,positive,Youtube,,,,That's sort of the um in-situ<br>reuse story but the part of it<br>that i find really interesting<br>and different is that rather<br>than replacing the facade<br>which looked quite tired and<br>perhaps dated what they did is<br>they dismantled it um and<br>transported around 3000 square<br>meters of it to a pop-up<br>factory where each panel was<br>inspected cleaned and had the<br>gaskets replaced and then it<br>was installed back on the<br>building which resulted in a<br>66 saving in cost and even<br>things like paving and other<br>roof materials were reused<br>products from other demolished<br>building  this is a this is a<br>great example of of<br>dismantling in a building and<br>and refurbishing and a great<br>example of a circular economy

195-14,,we might not have all the answers yet but we have to start somewhere if we want to make this transformation possible thats absolutely right  ive i think with many things in the circular economy you often start to get almost a bit confused around the circularity of responsibilities why should we design for deconstruction when theres no market for it at the end but its funny because a while back i was making dinner and i got to thinking that someone must have invented the tin can before the tin opener and i googled it and in fact the tin opener was only brought to market some  years after the invention of the tin can so the inventor designed it knowing that it was something transformational but without having all the answers to know how it could be used in terms of circular economy and design for deconstruction we shouldnt wait to have all the answers to start doing whats in our area of influence you know once we start doing what we can do that will start the engine of the circular economy and it will make reuse more viable eventually,positive,Youtube,,,,"we might not have all the<br>answers yet but we have to<br>start somewhere if we want to<br>make this transformation<br>possible that's absolutely<br>right,  i've I think with many<br>things in the circular economy<br>you often start to get almost<br>a bit confused around the<br>circularity of<br>responsibilities.

202-3,,when they can be remanufactured in their life its a lot easy and we dont have any chemical byproducts as well and so our aim was and question to this to the supply the industry and the suppliers was to try and source materials that could either be an upcycled from other project projects in another nontoxic way or we can be recycled back in the manufacturing stream in a nontoxic way the blue walls are made out of or techs theyre made out of  pe t bottles so theyre up cycled and actually just pinned together so the prefabricated are easy to take apart we can actually change them over the lifespan of the building and also we can send them back to the manufacturer and give them remanufactured into new boards as well this prototype have been engineered in order to reduce the amount of energy used following the passivhaus concept one side its the actual envelope design which is it was engineered in order to have high performances and reduce the actual amount of energy spent in heating up the building,positive,Youtube,,,, when they can be<br>remanufactured in their life<br>it's  a lot easy and we don't<br>have any  chemical byproducts<br>as well and so our  aim was<br>and question to this to the<br>supply the industry and the<br>suppliers  was to try and<br>source materials that  could<br>either be an upcycled from<br>other  project projects in<br>another non-toxic  way or we<br>can be recycled back in the<br>manufacturing stream in a non-<br>toxic way  the blue walls are<br>made out of or Tech's  they're<br>made out of 80% PE t bottles<br>so  they're up cycled and<br>actually just  pinned together<br>so the prefabricated are  easy<br>to take apart we can actually<br>change them over the lifespan<br>of the  building and also we<br>can send them back  to the<br>manufacturer and give them<br>remanufactured into new boards<br>as well  this prototype have<br>been engineered in  order to<br>reduce the amount of energy<br>used following the Passivhaus<br>concept  one side it's the<br>actual envelope design  which<br>is it was engineered in order<br>to  have high performances and<br>reduce the  actual amount of<br>energy spent in heating  up<br>the building
202-4,,on the other hand we have a series of sensors that can read the temperature and the various parameter the influenced environment in a house for this prototype we have a design a ventilation system which actually which allows to exchange external fresh air into the house to provide adequate indoor air quality we have used d printing and laser cut as technologies to develop this unit all the internal components they are d printed with  recycled beauty which comes from old bottles we only have discipline direct current power originally we designed at the building to have as little energy as possible so all the system which use energy for instance lighting or electronics there are so that we have the tablas we have the tvs theyre all designed so that they can take either  volts  volts  volts  volts for the tv and  volts for some of the lighting as well the the dc network that we have though is a is mainly electronics and so it made sense to power it straight from from the battery system,positive,Youtube,,,,on the other hand we have a<br>series  of sensors that can<br>read the  temperature and the<br>various parameter  the<br>influenced environment in a<br>house  for this prototype we<br>have a design a  ventilation<br>system which actually which<br>allows to exchange external<br>fresh air  into the house to<br>provide adequate  indoor air<br>quality we have used 3d<br>printing and laser cut as<br>technologies  to develop this<br>unit all the internal<br>components they are 3d printed<br>with 90%  recycled Beauty<br>which comes from old  bottles<br>we only have discipline direct<br>current power originally we<br>designed at  the building to<br>have as little energy as<br>possible so all the system<br>which use  energy for instance<br>lighting or  electronics there<br>are so that we have  the<br>Tablas we have the TVs they're<br>all  designed so that they can<br>take either 5  volts 12 volts<br>24 volts 19 volts for the  TV<br>and 48 volts for some of the<br>lighting  as well the the DC<br>network that we have  though<br>is a is mainly electronics and<br>so  it made sense to power it<br>straight from  from the<br>battery system
202-5,,the battery system that weve selected is a battery system that uses a salt water solution is from a company called aqua on and its yeah we selected it because the it is nontoxic and its also certified  cradletocradle which means all the parts that make up the battery are coming from a source which then can be you know can be reused to make something new,positive,Youtube,,,,the battery  system that we've<br>selected is a battery  system<br>that uses a salt water<br>solution  is from a company<br>called aqua on  and it's yeah<br>we selected it because the  it<br>is non-toxic and it's also<br>certified  100% cradle-to-<br>cradle which means all  the<br>parts that make up the battery<br>are  coming from a source<br>which then can be  you know<br>can be reused to make<br>something  new

203-2,,so we have outlined three strategies in which the circular economy can help address the emissions that come from the built environment sector but now lets get practical and lets hear from some of the examples from the people that are making this work in reality first let me take you some miles away from where i am now and lets take a closer look at the building that its at the heart of london this building is called one triton square next we will hear from my conversation with grace di benedetto the structural engineer at arab who will be telling us all about designing for deconstruction and what some of the economical and environmental benefits of this approach are lets take a look so thank you grace di benedetto for being here with us today as part of our circular economy show by the alan mccarthy foundation um i would like us to start the conversation by talking a little bit about something i read the other day i was reading the bbc news and i saw this article that said that a uk the uks top engineers are urging the government to stop demolishing buildings,positive,Youtube,,,,so we have outlined three<br>strategies in which the<br>circular economy can help<br>address the emissions that<br>come from the built<br>environment sector but now<br>let's get practical and let's<br>hear from some of the examples<br>from the people that are<br>making this work in reality<br>first let me take you some<br>miles away from where i am now<br>and let's take a closer look<br>at the building that it's at<br>the heart of london this<br>building is called one triton<br>square next we will hear from<br>my conversation with grace di<br>benedetto the structural<br>engineer at arab who will be<br>telling us all about designing<br>for deconstruction and what<br>some of the economical and<br>environmental benefits of this<br>approach are let's take a look<br>so thank you grace di<br>benedetto for being here with<br>us today as part of our<br>circular economy show by the<br>alan mccarthy foundation um i<br>would like us to start the<br>conversation by talking a<br>little bit about something i<br>read the other day i was<br>reading the bbc news and i saw<br>this article that said that a<br>uk the uk's top engineers are<br>urging the government to stop<br>demolishing buildings
203-3,,and i couldnt help by asking but ask myself why are we still doing it so i i was like i need to ask this to grace thats absolutely right um it is a big question why are we demolishing buildings today from the outset it seems like it doesnt make sense we have these fantastic stores of materials that are high quality and valuable materials weve spent millions of pounds to create these buildings why are we letting them become piles or rubble and there are many reasons for it um the buildings that have been designed have not been designed to be taken apart theyve been designed to be ripped apart and crushed for land for landfill or for downgrading so theres at the moment many logistical issues um to actually deconstructing buildings as opposed to demolishing them and theres also a really big challenge around if we are to switch to deconstruction what are the costs associated with that and that can scare a lot of of clients um from you know choosing deconstruction over demolition um so yeah theres a its a really big subject,neutral,Youtube,,,,and i couldn't help by asking<br>but ask myself why are we<br>still doing it so i i was like<br>i need to ask this to grace<br>that's absolutely right um it<br>is a big question why are we<br>demolishing buildings today<br>from the outset it seems like<br>it doesn't make sense we have<br>these fantastic stores of<br>materials that are high<br>quality and valuable materials<br>we've spent millions of pounds<br>to create these buildings why<br>are we letting them become<br>piles or rubble and there are<br>many reasons for it um the<br>buildings that have been<br>designed have not been<br>designed to be taken apart<br>they've been designed to be<br>ripped apart and crushed for<br>land for landfill or for<br>downgrading so there's at the<br>moment many logistical issues<br>um to actually deconstructing<br>buildings as opposed to<br>demolishing them and there's<br>also a really big challenge<br>around if we are to switch to<br>deconstruction what are the<br>costs associated with that and<br>that can scare a lot of of<br>clients um from you know<br>choosing deconstruction over<br>demolition um so yeah there's<br>a it's a really big subject
203-4,,but i think the key the key item is at the design stage so its what our engineers and architects and designers can do to change from the demolition to deconstruction and thats why why we are here today to hopefully give the audience uh a little bit of an overview of what that can look like in in practice so what does better design for buildings look like and what specifically is design for the construction sure so design for deconstruction is a philosophy where buildings are designed intentionally for material recovery and reuse at the end of life so like i said currently buildings not only have zero value at the end of life they actually cost money to demolish and process the waste so instead when we design for deconstruction you have this fantastic ability to create buildings which which act as these stockpiles of these valuable materials that can be easily taken apart and used in new buildings instead of virgin materials and in doing that that helps us to sort of chip away at the enormous amount of carbon emissions which are associated with the build environment,positive,Youtube,,,,but i think the key the key<br>item is at the design stage so<br>it's what our engineers and<br>architects and designers can<br>do to change from the<br>demolition to deconstruction<br>and that's why why we are here<br>today to hopefully give the<br>audience uh a little bit of an<br>overview of what that can look<br>like in in practice so what<br>does better design for<br>buildings look like and what<br>specifically is design for the<br>construction sure so design<br>for deconstruction is a<br>philosophy where buildings are<br>designed intentionally for<br>material recovery and reuse at<br>the end of life so like i said<br>currently buildings not only<br>have zero value at the end of<br>life they actually cost money<br>to demolish and process the<br>waste so instead when we<br>design for deconstruction you<br>have this fantastic ability to<br>create buildings which which<br>act as these stockpiles of<br>these valuable materials that<br>can be easily taken apart and<br>used in new buildings instead<br>of virgin materials and in<br>doing that that helps us to<br>sort of chip away at the<br>enormous amount of carbon<br>emissions which are associated<br>with the build environment
203-5,,in terms of actually doing this practically um the deconstructed like the ideal deconstructable building is very similar to a lego lego building so we try and design components that are modular connections that are reversible just like lego and materials that are robust and reusable and we want to try to avoid using any paints or coatings that might be difficult to remove and we want to ensure that the components of the building are easy to access and theres a plan for how they can sort of safely be removed without damaging the item and i mean you you brought it this up in your first in your first answer the importance of of design of the design stage and you know how much of our environmental impact is determined by decisions that we made in that crucial design stage and i mean obviously as you speak it comes to mind that one of the benefits is probably you know reducing the amount of waste that the builtin vitamin environment produces but what are other benefits that perhaps designing for the construction can have economic or environmental any kind of benefits,neutral,Youtube,,,,in terms of actually doing<br>this practically um the<br>deconstructed like the ideal<br>deconstructable building is<br>very similar to a lego lego<br>building so we try and design<br>components that are modular<br>connections that are<br>reversible just like lego and<br>materials that are robust and<br>reusable and we want to try to<br>avoid using any paints or<br>coatings that might be<br>difficult to remove and we<br>want to ensure that the<br>components of the building are<br>easy to access and there's a<br>plan for how they can sort of<br>safely be removed without<br>damaging the item and i mean<br>you you brought it this up in<br>your first in your first<br>answer the importance of of<br>design of the design stage and<br>you know how much of our<br>environmental impact is<br>determined by decisions that<br>we made in that crucial design<br>stage and i mean obviously as<br>you speak it comes to mind<br>that one of the benefits is<br>probably you know reducing the<br>amount of waste that the<br>built-in vitamin environment<br>produces but what are other<br>benefits that perhaps<br>designing for the construction<br>can have economic or<br>environmental any kind of<br>benefits
203-6,,sure so  of global carbon emissions is attributed to the carbon which is embodied in the materials that we use so in designing for deconstruction we are potentially opening up a stock of materials that can be reclaimed at the end of life and reused in new buildings which then in turn reduces the carbon emissions associated with new buildings and in terms of economic you know in going for design for deconstruction you know one of the challenges thats often cited is the increased use of labor at the end of life to deconstruct you know in order to to unbolt everything um rather than just go through it with an earth mover involves a lot more people but that is a real great opportunity for job creation um as is you know refurbishment of things that come out of existing buildings for um for reclamation is also a really laborintensive process that that can create jobs in the local economy and grace you you work for for arab and and you obviously have a lot of experience working on the circular economy and and the built environment um,positive,Youtube,,,,sure so 11 of global carbon<br>emissions is attributed to the<br>carbon which is embodied in<br>the materials that we use so<br>in designing for<br>deconstruction we are<br>potentially opening up a stock<br>of materials that can be<br>reclaimed at the end of life<br>and reused in new buildings<br>which then in turn reduces the<br>carbon emissions associated<br>with new buildings and in<br>terms of economic you know in<br>going for design for<br>deconstruction you know one of<br>the challenges that's often<br>cited is the increased use of<br>labor at the end of life to<br>deconstruct you know in order<br>to to unbolt everything um<br>rather than just go through it<br>with an earth mover involves a<br>lot more people but that is a<br>real great opportunity for job<br>creation um as is you know<br>refurbishment of things that<br>come out of existing buildings<br>for um for reclamation is also<br>a really labor-intensive<br>process that that can create<br>jobs in the local economy and<br>grace you you work for for<br>arab and and you obviously<br>have a lot of experience<br>working on the circular<br>economy and and the built<br>environment um
203-7,,you have a building that our audience has seen before in in a video called one triton square what makes this building so special or different from others sure so to start with its a refurbishment project which is something thats becoming much more common um but it is still perhaps not the norm um so that project one trident square is an existing building that was built in the s and the client wanted to maximize the value of the site by increasing the floor area by around  if we were doing business as usual the design team would usually say like  theres theres no way that we can make that happen without demolishing and rebuilding but instead they found an opportunity to retain much of the existing structure while adding new stories and infilling empty space and ultimately this resulted in   of the embodied carbon um compared to a new demolition to a new build and demolition scheme and thats sort of the um insitu reuse story but the part of,positive,Youtube,,,, you have a building that our<br>audience has seen before in in<br>a video called one triton<br>square what makes this<br>building so special or<br>different from others sure so<br>to start with it's a<br>refurbishment project which is<br>something that's becoming much<br>more common um but it is still<br>perhaps not the norm um so<br>that project one trident<br>square is an existing building<br>that was built in the 90s and<br>the client wanted to maximize<br>the value of the site by<br>increasing the floor area by<br>around 70 if we were doing<br>business as usual the design<br>team would usually say like 70<br>there's there's no way that we<br>can make that happen without<br>demolishing and rebuilding but<br>instead they found an<br>opportunity to retain much of<br>the existing structure while<br>adding new stories and<br>infilling empty space and<br>ultimately this resulted in 50<br>56 of the embodied carbon um<br>compared to a new demolition<br>to a new build and demolition<br>scheme and that's sort of the<br>um in-situ reuse story but the<br>part of
203-8,,rather than replacing the facade which looked quite tired and perhaps dated what they did is they dismantled it um and transported around  square meters of it to a popup factory where each panel was inspected cleaned and had the gaskets replaced and then it was installed back on the building which resulted in a  saving in cost and even things like paving and other roof materials were reused products from other demolished building buildings this is a this is a great example of of dismantling in a building and and refurbishing and a great example of a circular economy but are these options scalable at the moment yeah i mean theres nothing about design for deconstruction which means it cant be used on projects of any size but theres definitely an education piece that needs to be done to develop guidance around design for deconstruction not just for clients but also for designers contractors demolition experts so they really understand the technicalities of achieving it um and i think to scale we also need more case studies and more largescale demonstrators that can really reassure stakeholders and insurers um and i think really a really big part,positive,Youtube,,,,rather than replacing the<br>facade which looked quite<br>tired and perhaps dated what<br>they did is they dismantled it<br>um and transported around 3000<br>square meters of it to a pop-<br>up factory where each panel<br>was inspected cleaned and had<br>the gaskets replaced and then<br>it was installed back on the<br>building which resulted in a<br>66 saving in cost and even<br>things like paving and other<br>roof materials were reused<br>products from other demolished<br>building buildings this is a<br>this is a great example of of<br>dismantling in a building and<br>and refurbishing and a great<br>example of a circular economy<br>but are these options scalable<br>at the moment yeah i mean<br>there's nothing about design<br>for deconstruction which means<br>it can't be used on projects<br>of any size but there's<br>definitely an education piece<br>that needs to be done to<br>develop guidance around design<br>for deconstruction not just<br>for clients but also for<br>designers contractors<br>demolition experts so they<br>really understand the<br>technicalities of achieving it<br>um and i think to scale we<br>also need more case studies<br>and more large-scale<br>demonstrators that can really<br>reassure stakeholders and<br>insurers um and i think really<br>a really big part

203-10,,for things like brick thats been done for ages thats really common material to reclaim but i think the challenge here is that you kind of put into this chicken and egg situation so for instance if i wanted to get hold of  tons of reclaimed steel i would really struggle to find that quantity of material in existence and so i probably would think i would maybe do a look online and i wouldnt find anything and because of that the people at the end of life the demolition contractors and the salvages they dont see any demand for these materials and so they dont think its worth the additional effort to carefully deconstruct to store and to refurbish the materials because they just dont see people who are wanting it,negative,Youtube,,,,for things like brick that's<br>been done for ages that's<br>really common material to<br>reclaim but i think the<br>challenge here is that you<br>kind of put into this chicken<br>and egg situation so for<br>instance if i wanted to get<br>hold of 35 tons of reclaimed<br>steel i would really struggle<br>to find that quantity of<br>material in existence and so i<br>probably would think i would<br>maybe do a look online and i<br>wouldn't find anything and<br>because of that the people at<br>the end of life the demolition<br>contractors and the salvages<br>they don't see any demand for<br>these materials and so they<br>don't think it's worth the<br>additional effort to carefully<br>deconstruct to store and to<br>refurbish the materials<br>because they just don't see<br>people who are wanting it

203-20,,and our first priority is to design out waste that starts to really transform and rethink how we look at a building ill give you a dumb example lets say youre remodeling your bathroom and lets say you pick out an eight inch tile sorry im american i dont do metric but if we do an eightinch tile um well shouldnt that bathroom also be some module of eight inches so that way the tile space out evenly and you can avoid having a cut you know it always drives me crazy when youre in a bathroom and you see that little extra sliver of tile because someone didnt plan well well we can know that in advance so we can design the bathroom on a modular  inches and get nice clean edges that reduces waste it also helps you with other things because everything in the construction is basically on some module of  inches right bricks concrete block tiles plywood everything is based on that same module and so if we design to the module we can start to reduce waste in a very easy way and save cost at the same time,neutral,Youtube,,,,and our first priority is to<br>design out waste that starts<br>to really transform and<br>rethink how we look at a<br>building i'll give you a dumb<br>example let's say you're<br>remodeling your bathroom and<br>let's say you pick out an<br>eight inch tile sorry i'm<br>american i don't do metric but<br>if we do an eight-inch tile um<br>well shouldn't that bathroom<br>also be some module of eight<br>inches so that way the tile<br>space out evenly and you can<br>avoid having a cut you know it<br>always drives me crazy when<br>you're in a bathroom and you<br>see that little extra sliver<br>of tile because someone didn't<br>plan well well we can know<br>that in advance so we can<br>design the bathroom on a<br>modular 8 inches and get nice<br>clean edges that reduces waste<br>it also helps you with other<br>things because everything in<br>the construction is basically<br>on some module of 8 inches<br>right bricks concrete block<br>tiles plywood everything is<br>based on that same module and<br>so if we design to the module<br>we can start to reduce waste<br>in a very easy way and save<br>cost at the same time

203-24,,which is well i dont know because weve always done it this way right you have a not what is it nine trillion dollar construction industry or something insane thats very embedded and used to a certain way of of building and they know that its flawed and they know its not perfect but its what they know and so getting them to change is difficult in addition we have a code system throughout the world thats really based on three main materials stone um masonry and steel or im sorry wood masonry and steel and the codes written for that and that makes total sense but if you wanted to use something alternative to those big three youd have a fight on your hands youd have a bit of a challenge youd have to demonstrate and prove that it meets these requirements we have this now with a product called mass timber its really engineered wood so its a renewable resource its a carbon sink its engineered to be as strong as steel but weve been slowly fighting with the code to get it to accept that it really has a a great fire resistance rating because,negative,Youtube,,,,which is well i don't know<br>because we've always done it<br>this way right you have a not<br>what is it nine trillion<br>dollar construction industry<br>or something insane that's<br>very embedded and used to a<br>certain way of of building and<br>they know that it's flawed and<br>they know it's not perfect but<br>it's what they know and so<br>getting them to change is<br>difficult in addition we have<br>a code system throughout the<br>world that's really based on<br>three main materials stone um<br>masonry and steel or i'm sorry<br>wood masonry and steel and the<br>code's written for that and<br>that makes total sense but if<br>you wanted to use something<br>alternative to those big three<br>you'd have a fight on your<br>hands you'd have a bit of a<br>challenge you'd have to<br>demonstrate and prove that it<br>meets these requirements we<br>have this now with a product<br>called mass timber it's really<br>engineered wood so it's a<br>renewable resource it's a<br>carbon sink it's engineered to<br>be as strong as steel but<br>we've been slowly fighting<br>with the code to get it to<br>accept that it really has a a<br>great fire resistance rating<br>because

204-6,,into a regenerative dynamic where we work with and within the cycles of the living world but we also have an economy thats deeply divisive where the returns of value and opportunity are so often driven into the hands of a one percent so we have billions of people who cant meet their essential needs and a doubling of number of billionaires in the world in the past decade so we need to turn this divisive economic dynamics into distributive economic dynamics so for me the st century economy is absolutely in the donut the question is how are we going to make our economy regenerative and how are we going to make it distributive and that is their thats the entry point now lets talk about economics in those terms lets reframe the starting point and lets dive in from there so important to talk about about framing and what im getting is that you basically are thinking about two main principles for the economy so it has to be regenerative by design and distributed by design and i think a lot of the work of what we do at the macarthur foundation overlaps here with with the work,positive,Youtube,,,,into a regenerative dynamic<br>where we work with and within<br>the cycles of the living world<br>but we also have an economy<br>that's deeply divisive  where<br>the returns of value and<br>opportunity are so often<br>driven into the hands of a one<br>percent so we have  billions<br>of people who can't meet their<br>essential needs and a doubling<br>of number of billionaires in<br>the world in the past  decade<br>so we need to turn this<br>divisive economic dynamics<br>into distributive economic<br>dynamics so  for me the 21st<br>century economy is absolutely<br>in the donut the question is<br>how are we going to make  our<br>economy regenerative and how<br>are we going to make it<br>distributive and that is their<br>that's  the entry point now<br>let's talk about economics in<br>those terms let's reframe the<br>starting point and let's dive<br>in from there  so important to<br>talk about about framing and<br>what i'm getting is that you<br>basically are thinking about<br>two main  principles for the<br>economy so it has to be<br>regenerative by design and<br>distributed by design and i<br>think a lot of the work of<br>what we do at the  macarthur<br>foundation overlaps here with<br>with the work
204-7,,that you do um because because we want to have a regenerative economy and i wanted to ask you kate um as part of this what role do you think the circular economy plays in these i think its key so let me grab my favorite piece of hosepipe you know this is our degenerative economy its the linear take make use lose of industrial systems that weve inherited and that linear degenerative process is what pushes us over planetary boundaries it takes again and again from earth sources it throws waste again and again into earth sinks we have to turn this linear arrow into a circular one right we have to work with and within the cycles of the living world so that resources are never used up theyre used again and again far more collectively more creatively and more carefully and more slowly so i think a circular economy is a necessity in the search of becoming regenerative its we cant do it without reusing resources and recognizing that waste from one process is food for the next how do we make that distributive at the same time for me thats the really interesting question how do,positive,Youtube,,,,that you do um because because<br>we want to have a<br>regenerative economy and i<br>wanted to ask you kate um as<br>part of this what role do you<br>think the circular  economy<br>plays in these i think it's<br>key so let me grab my favorite<br>piece of hosepipe  you know<br>this is our degenerative<br>economy it's the linear take<br>make use lose of industrial<br>systems  that we've inherited<br>and that linear degenerative<br>process is what pushes us over<br>planetary boundaries it  takes<br>again and again from earth<br>sources it throws waste again<br>and again into earth sinks  we<br>have to turn this linear arrow<br>into a circular one right we<br>have to work  with and within<br>the cycles of the living world<br>so that resources are never<br>used up they're used again and<br>again far more collectively<br>more creatively  and more<br>carefully and more slowly so i<br>think a circular economy is  a<br>necessity in the search of<br>becoming regenerative it's we<br>can't do it without reusing<br>resources and recognizing that<br>waste from one process is food<br>for the next how do we make<br>that distributive at the  same<br>time for me that's the really<br>interesting question how do
204-8,,we make sure that the circular economy not only takes us towards regenerative design it takes us towards distributive design so for example i believe we need industries where that make products that have the right to repair that are modular by design so that instead of individual companies having their own circular supply chain send everything back to me and its within my intellectual property rights and these are my materials and nobody else knows how i use them and its a kind of corporate loop that is never going to work because nature doesnt do that nature doesnt create a series of  little loops nature creates an ecosystem right nature puts resources back into the ecosystem back as basic building blocks and then starts again so if we want to mimic nature in the way we create circular economies we need an ecosystem of plastics use an ecosystem of metals and an ecosystem of electronics and an ecosystem of ceramics and that means that the materials need to be labeled and open source in their design so anyone who ends up with a material in their hand knows what kind of material it is and is,positive,Youtube,,,,we make sure that the circular<br>economy not only takes us<br>towards regenerative design<br>it takes us towards<br>distributive design so for<br>example i believe we need<br>industries where that  make<br>products that have the right<br>to repair that are modular by<br>design so that instead of<br>individual companies having<br>their own circular supply<br>chain send everything back to<br>me and it's within my<br>intellectual property rights<br>and these  are my materials<br>and nobody else knows how i<br>use them and it's a kind of<br>corporate loop that  is never<br>going to work because nature<br>doesn't do that nature doesn't<br>create a series of 100 little<br>loops  nature creates an<br>ecosystem right nature puts<br>resources back into the<br>ecosystem  back as basic<br>building blocks and then<br>starts again so if we want to<br>mimic nature in the way we<br>create circular economies  we<br>need an ecosystem of plastics<br>use an ecosystem of metals and<br>an ecosystem of electronics<br>and an  ecosystem of ceramics<br>and that means that the<br>materials need to be labeled<br>and open source in their<br>design  so anyone who ends up<br>with a material in their hand<br>knows what kind of material it<br>is and is
204-9,,able to feed it back into the ecosystem so i think it has really farreaching implications for ensuring that we dont go down this corporate siloed circularity but that we have a ecosystem circularity and that requires a regulation and a collaboration between industries to make that ecosystem and to make those shared commons based technologies and shared standards that everybody can connect to but also i would say that the circular economy has a huge potential to be an employment creating a job creating and a meaningful job creating economy right theres theres creativity and joy and meaning in figuring out how to use earth resources again and again how to repurpose them what can they become next time so it enables architects and engineers and designers to be innovative and to come up with new solutions and those are the folks i meet who work in big companies who cant wait to get going making these new designs theyre often held behind a lobby a kind of corporate lobby that are trying to stop any change in regulations but if only that corporate lobby would get out the way and the regulations could be changed the innovative inspiration,positive,Youtube,,,,able to feed it back into the<br>ecosystem  so i think it has<br>really far-reaching<br>implications for ensuring that<br>we don't go down this<br>corporate siloed circularity<br>but that we have a ecosystem<br>circularity and that requires<br>a regulation and a<br>collaboration between<br>industries to make that<br>ecosystem and to make those<br>shared commons based<br>technologies and shared<br>standards that everybody can<br>connect to but also i would<br>say that the circular economy<br>has a huge potential  to be an<br>employment creating a job<br>creating and a meaningful job<br>creating  economy right<br>there's there's creativity and<br>joy and meaning in figuring<br>out how to use earth<br>resources again and again how<br>to repurpose them what can<br>they become next time so it<br>enables architects and<br>engineers  and designers to be<br>innovative and to come up with<br>new solutions and those are<br>the folks i meet who work in<br>big companies  who can't wait<br>to get going making these new<br>designs they're often held<br>behind a  lobby a kind of<br>corporate lobby that are<br>trying to stop any change in<br>regulations but if only that<br>corporate lobby would  get out<br>the way and the regulations<br>could be changed the<br>innovative inspiration
204-10,,of that generation  designers can be unleashed and so theres a lot of good jobs i mean again if i bring back this network think of all the jobs required to make the connections between these nodes it is an employment creating uh system so thats another way in which it can be distributed by design so i think it connects very closely with the work of the element class foundation and i think the question always is how do we ensure that as we promote the circular economy it doesnt become a siloed corporate captured circular economy it becomes part of a large ecosystem and its distributed by design as well and this shows the the importance of having a system approach and and really including all the actors of our economy and not just the businesses but also the policymakers the academics and the communities et cetera so youre presenting us with a very different picture that can set the very different indicators and and and ultimately lead to different policies different businesses and different ways of of doing stuff um and and you mentioned you published the donut in  your book in  and i know,neutral,Youtube,,,,of that generation   designers<br>can be unleashed and so<br>there's a lot of good jobs i<br>mean again if i bring back<br>this network  think of all the<br>jobs required to make the<br>connections between these<br>nodes it is an employment<br>creating uh system  so that's<br>another way in which it can be<br>distributed by design so i<br>think it connects very closely<br>with the work of the element<br>class foundation  and i think<br>the question always is how do<br>we ensure that as we promote<br>the circular economy it<br>doesn't become a siloed<br>corporate  captured circular<br>economy it becomes part of a<br>large ecosystem and it's<br>distributed by design as well<br>and this shows the the<br>importance of having a system<br>approach and and really<br>including all the actors of<br>our economy and not just the<br>businesses but also the<br>policymakers the academics and<br>the communities et cetera so<br>you're presenting us with a<br>very different picture that<br>can set the very different<br>indicators and and and<br>ultimately lead to different<br>policies different businesses<br>and different ways of of doing<br>stuff um and and you mentioned<br>you published  the donut in<br>2012 your book in 2017 and i<br>know
204-11,,youve been working really hard on on how to downscale this this this framework which can perhaps seem a bit theoretical and and how to actually apply it to the different levels of the economy um so cities why why are you focusing on city scale and and how do you how do you move from that image that framework to actually uh talking about uh the city level yeah so when the donut was first published in  it is a it is a compass for the global or the planetary scale it tries to plot all of humanity within the planetary boundaries and very quickly people started saying can we turn that into a tool for here for our city our town our nation our country and wanted to downscale it and for years we couldnt figure out how would you downscale it what would that look like whats the smart way to do that and then i got into a fantastic conversation with the biomimicry thinker janine benius who had sort of flipped the donut inside out as it were and had this idea for for using it and we put our ideas together,neutral,Youtube,,,,you've been working really<br>hard on on how to downscale<br>this this this framework which<br>can  perhaps seem a bit<br>theoretical and and how to<br>actually apply it to the<br>different levels of the<br>economy  um so cities why why<br>are you focusing on city scale<br>and and how do you how do you<br>move from that  image that<br>framework to actually uh<br>talking about uh the city<br>level yeah so when the donut<br>was first  published in 2012<br>it is a it is a compass for<br>the global  or the planetary<br>scale it tries to plot all of<br>humanity within the planetary<br>boundaries  and very quickly<br>people started saying can we<br>turn that into a tool for here<br>for our city our town our<br>nation our country and wanted<br>to downscale it and for years<br>we couldn't figure out how<br>would you downscale it what<br>would that look like what's<br>the smart way to do that and<br>then i got into a fantastic<br>conversation with the<br>biomimicry thinker janine<br>benius who  had sort of<br>flipped the donut inside out<br>as it were and had this idea<br>for for using it and we put<br>our ideas together
204-12,,and we came up with a framework for down scaling it which i feel very confident has a huge ability to be applied at multiple scales so it could be applied from a neighborhood to a town to a city to a district to a nation or even to a community of nations and weve started with cities partly because theres a real energy going on in cities in these current decades theres something about cities is it that theyre the right size that they can make a difference but theyre not so big that people cant connect theres a pride certainly here in the uk i think people feel more of a pride of the city that theyre part of rather than saying im proud to be part of the uk so theres more of a connection with that level of place and also a lot of creating economic transformation happens in the way we lay out our streets in the way we move materials around so theres something about the spatial scale of a city that can try out new things we also got in touch with the c which is a network of  cities with mayors,positive,Youtube,,,,and we came up with a<br>framework for down scaling it<br>which i feel very confident<br>has a huge ability to be<br>applied at  multiple scales so<br>it could be applied from a<br>neighborhood to a town to a<br>city to a district to a nation<br>or even to a community of<br>nations and we've started with<br>cities partly because there's<br>a real energy  going on in<br>cities in these current<br>decades there's something<br>about cities is it that<br>they're the right size that<br>they can make a difference but<br>they're not so big that people<br>can't connect there's a pride<br>certainly  here in the uk i<br>think people feel more of a<br>pride of the city that they're<br>part of rather than saying i'm<br>proud to be  part of the uk so<br>there's more of a connection<br>with that level of place  and<br>also a lot of creating<br>economic transformation<br>happens in the way we lay out<br>our  streets in the way we<br>move materials around so<br>there's something about the<br>spatial scale of a city that<br>can  try out new things we<br>also got in touch with the c40<br>which is a network of 96<br>cities with mayors
204-13,,who have committed to transforming their cities to keep global heating under  degrees and they said wed like to use the donut with some of our most ambitious cities so we started working together thats how we began the work with cities and weve actually begun in the cities of the global north in the high income countries because we think they have the greatest obligation and responsibility to lead this transformation given their historic responsibilities for climate and ecological impacts so weve begun with them and um so in for cities i know you have four main lenses that you look at when you try to approach the donut framework what what what are they and and why was it so important to incorporate as well the global perspective so heres the question that we invite any ambitious city any city that wants to be fit for the st century we invite it to ask itself and i and i just would invite anybody listening to this to think of a city that they know and love and look at it through this lens so heres the question how can your city be a home to thriving people,positive,Youtube,,,,  who have committed  to<br>transforming their cities to<br>keep global heating under 1.5<br>degrees and they said we'd<br>like to use the donut  with<br>some of our most ambitious<br>cities so we started working<br>together that's how we began<br>the work with cities and we've<br>actually begun in the cities<br>of the global north in the<br>high income countries because<br>we think they have the<br>greatest obligation  and<br>responsibility to lead this<br>transformation given their<br>historic responsibilities for<br>climate  and ecological<br>impacts so we've begun with<br>them and um so in for cities<br>i know you have four main<br>lenses that you look at when<br>you try to approach the donut<br>framework  what what what are<br>they and and why was it so<br>important to incorporate as<br>well the global  perspective<br>so here's the question that we<br>invite any ambitious  city any<br>city that wants to be fit for<br>the 21st century we invite it<br>to ask itself and i and i<br>just would invite anybody<br>listening to this to think of<br>a city that they know and love<br>and look at it through this<br>lens so here's the question<br>how can your city be a home to<br>thriving people
204-14,,in a thriving place while respecting the wellbeing of all people and the health of the whole planet so thats a big question and you can hear in it theres both local aspiration to be thriving people whatever it means to the people of your city you know what it means to thrive will be different to the people of darussalam as to the people of stockholm so let each culture and community bring their history their meaning their way of living and say this is what it means to thrive here for us and how are we doing against that and then also part of the local aspiration what does it mean for your city to be a part of a thriving place every city on the planet is located in a different part of earths ecosystems some are mountains some are in valleys some are in the equator somewhere in the arctic circle and what natures doing in those places varies so nature has a genius as janine benious would say of thriving different in each of these places and we can learn from nature and aim for our cities to belong in that habitat,neutral,Youtube,,,,in a thriving place while<br>respecting the well-being of<br>all  people and the health of<br>the whole planet so that's a<br>big question and you can hear<br>in it there's both local<br>aspiration to be thriving<br>people whatever it means to<br>the  people of your city you<br>know what it means to thrive<br>will be different to the<br>people of darussalam  as to<br>the people of stockholm so let<br>each culture and community<br>bring their history their<br>meaning  their way of living<br>and say this is what it means<br>to thrive here for us and how<br>are we doing against that and<br>then also part of the local<br>aspiration what does it mean<br>for your city to be a part of<br>a thriving place  every city<br>on the planet is located in a<br>different part of earth's<br>ecosystems some are mountains<br>some are in valleys  some are<br>in the equator somewhere in<br>the arctic circle and what<br>nature's doing in those places<br>varies so nature has a genius<br>as janine benious would say of<br>thriving different in each of<br>these  places and we can learn<br>from nature and aim for our<br>cities to belong in that<br>habitat
204-15,,so lets say im in the city of oxford in the uk and and the nearest natural habitat is a place called white and woods just a couple of miles outside the city i could go to white and woods and say this is what natures doing here this is how nature thrives and lets take the measurements of white to wood lets measure how much carbon dioxide these woods are sequestering how much groundwater theyre storing after a storm how much biodiversity the woods are housing how much the woods are cooling the air in the summer from the treetops to the forest floor so we take the metrics of nature and we say what would it mean for our city to aim to actually match or even exceed the generosity of the wildland next door so that our cities would be functionally indistinct from the wildland in which theyre embedded as janine would say we we humans come to truly belong in the landscapes in which we are nestled so thats local aspiration to be thriving people in a thriving place and many cities just focus on that we want to have good lives for our residents,positive,Youtube,,,,so let's say i'm in the city<br>of oxford in the uk and and<br>the nearest natural habitat is<br>a place called white  and<br>woods just a couple of miles<br>outside the city i could go to<br>white and woods and say this<br>is what nature's doing here<br>this is how  nature thrives<br>and let's take the<br>measurements of white to wood<br>let's measure how much carbon<br>dioxide these woods are<br>sequestering how much<br>groundwater they're storing<br>after a storm how much<br>biodiversity the woods are<br>housing how much the woods are<br>cooling the air in the summer<br>from the treetops to the<br>forest floor so  we take the<br>metrics of nature and we say<br>what would it mean for our<br>city to aim to actually  match<br>or even exceed the generosity<br>of the wildland next door so<br>that our cities would be<br>functionally  indistinct from<br>the wildland in which they're<br>embedded as janine would say<br>we we humans come to truly<br>belong in the  landscapes in<br>which we are nestled so that's<br>local aspiration to be<br>thriving people in a thriving<br>place  and many cities just<br>focus on that we want to have<br>good lives for our residents

204-19,,is this is following a bit what k just explained as well and especially in the global north our countries um and our cities where we are today are over consuming and consuming a lot and its all based on a lot of these global supply chains so for example the transportation movements are huge in this sense by working towards a circular food system in cities youre reducing the cloud the emission impact that come with those transportation but it could also provide extra jobs locally so urban production urban consumption and bring it all close to the city while reducing the food waste and bringing the nutrients back to the soil close to home so i think this touches upon quite some themes that kate just explained that the donut brings together and what does this donut economics framework give a city that other frameworks dont i think thats a very nice question sk just said were working with c quite some c cities and donut economics action lab and what we have seen in this learning journey because we have just started a year and a half ago so im not pretending to know but what we,positive,Youtube,,,,is  this is following a bit<br>what k just explained as well<br>and especially in the global<br>north our  countries um and<br>our cities where we are today<br>are over consuming and<br>consuming a lot  and it's all<br>based on a lot of these global<br>supply chains so for example<br>the transportation  movements<br>are huge in this sense by<br>working towards a  circular<br>food system in cities you're<br>reducing the cloud the<br>emission impact  that come<br>with those transportation but<br>it could also provide extra<br>jobs locally so urban<br>production  urban consumption<br>and bring it all close to the<br>city while reducing the food<br>waste and  bringing the<br>nutrients back to the soil<br>close to home so i think this<br>touches upon quite some themes<br>that kate just  explained that<br>the donut brings together and<br>what does this donut economics<br>framework  give a city that<br>other frameworks don't i think<br>that's a very nice  question<br>sk just said we're working<br>with c quite some c-40 cities<br>and  donut economics action<br>lab and what we have seen in<br>this learning journey because<br>we have  just started a year<br>and a half ago so i'm not<br>pretending to know but what we
204-20,,see is that it connects it connects the minds and hearts it connects people from different departments within the city it connects civil society organization businesses and the city officials through one framework its very intuitive and it provides a narrative that everyone can relate to so its something that i have not seen before when working with cities actually and andre kate i just mentioned why you why why the donut why she started sorry working with um cities in in the global north lets say um do you believe that that the framework could be applied to other contexts or other cities around the world um yes we definitely believe that its been a large part of the discussions that weve had we have currently developed the methodology donut economics action lab has developed a methodology weve inputted into that and its mainly piloted amongst cities with a similar profile with high economic activity and also high consumption patterns so the tool the city portrait tool thats been created is suitable for these global north cities but i have we also recognized the fact that for example working on providing this social foundation for many global south cities,positive,Youtube,,,,see is that it connects it<br>connects the minds and hearts<br>it connects people from<br>different  departments within<br>the city it connects civil<br>society organization<br>businesses and the city<br>officials through one<br>framework it's very  intuitive<br>and it provides a narrative<br>that everyone can relate to so<br>it's something that i have not<br>seen  before when working with<br>cities actually and andre kate<br>i just mentioned why you why<br>why the  donut why she started<br>sorry working with um cities<br>in in the global north let's<br>say  um do you believe that<br>that the framework could be<br>applied to other contexts or<br>other cities around  the world<br>um yes we definitely believe<br>that it's been  a large part<br>of the discussions that we've<br>had we have currently<br>developed the  methodology<br>donut economics action lab has<br>developed a methodology we've<br>inputted into that  and it's<br>mainly piloted amongst cities<br>with a similar profile  with<br>high economic activity and<br>also high consumption patterns<br>so the tool  the city portrait<br>tool that's been created is<br>suitable for these global<br>north cities  but i have we<br>also recognized the fact that<br>for example working on<br>providing  this social<br>foundation for many global<br>south cities

204-22,,some guiding principles but im not i think were learning uh a lot and well probably have more guiding principles or at least experiences to share in a short time or along the road weve um through some conversations with you weve understood that um there have been some unexpected results from applying the donor economics framework within amsterdam one of which has been the development of a coalition a donut economics coalition in amsterdam which some other cities are interested in could you talk to us a little bit about the role of circle economy in expanding the framework and its application globally and maybe a little bit about these coalitions that that are wanting to be developed around the world um ill answer the question about the donut coalitions uh first so the donut coalitions that we see our bottom up um our bottom up activities and and have actually been ignited by civil society organizations and a coalition of a lot of people that see the donut as a framework that they can work with for a better city for a thriving city a thriving place and um i think what weve seen in amsterdam that happened,positive,Youtube,,,,some guiding principles  but<br>i'm not i think we're learning<br>uh a lot and we'll probably<br>have more  guiding principles<br>or at least experiences to<br>share in a short time  or<br>along the road we've um<br>through some conversations<br>with  you we've understood<br>that um there have been some<br>unexpected results from<br>applying the donor economics<br>framework  within amsterdam<br>one of which has been the<br>development of a coalition a<br>donut economics coalition  in<br>amsterdam which some other<br>cities are interested in could<br>you talk to us a little bit<br>about the role of  circle<br>economy in expanding the<br>framework and its application<br>globally and maybe a little<br>bit about  these coalitions<br>that that are wanting to be<br>developed around the world  um<br>i'll answer the question about<br>the donut coalitions uh first<br>so the donut coalitions that<br>we  see our bottom up um our<br>bottom up activities and and<br>have  actually been ignited by<br>civil society organizations<br>and a coalition of  a lot of<br>people that see the donut as a<br>framework that they can work<br>with for a better city for a<br>thriving city a  thriving<br>place and um i think what<br>we've seen in amsterdam that<br>happened
204-23,,at this in simultaneously while we were working with the donut uh based on the donut model with the city itself but evelyn will talk about that later um we also saw that the donut coalition of educational institutes of other civil society organizations and a large set of businesses started and what were currently doing is bringing these together to accelerate all the great initiatives and you could see on the website of a donut coalition amsterdam for example how many donut deals as they call them citizen citizen initiatives based on the donuts there are so many of them but also in melbourne we see a similar donut collective arising which is very very inspiring actually and its really a bottomup movement um if i can say uh to your second question of the role of circle economy our role is to down scale it in a practical way to the city level were creating the participatory processes um and cocreative processes and obviously bring out also together with you the circular economy expertise to these cities and the yeah the fundamental need of a system a systemic change which is needed so thanks so much enrique before,positive,Youtube,,,,at this  in simultaneously<br>while we were working with the<br>donut uh based on the donut<br>model with the  city itself<br>but evelyn will talk about<br>that later um we also saw that<br>the donut coalition  of<br>educational institutes of<br>other civil society<br>organizations and a large set<br>of businesses started  and<br>what we're currently doing is<br>bringing these together to<br>accelerate all the great<br>initiatives and you could  see<br>on the website of a donut<br>coalition amsterdam for<br>example how many donut deals<br>as they call them citizen<br>citizen initiatives based on<br>the donuts there  are so many<br>of them but also in melbourne<br>we see a similar donut<br>collective arising which  is<br>very very inspiring actually<br>and it's really a bottom-up<br>movement um if i can say uh to<br>your second  question of the<br>role of circle economy our<br>role is to down scale it in a<br>practical way  to the city<br>level we're creating the<br>participatory processes um and<br>co-creative processes and<br>obviously bring out also<br>together with you the circular<br>economy expertise to these<br>cities and the yeah the<br>fundamental need of a system<br>a systemic change which is<br>needed so thanks so much<br>enrique before

204-26,,good afternoon to you all um what we did when we developed the first roadmap it was based on a research say journey to find out where we have to focus on and we decided back then a couple of years ago to focus on the build environment value chain and the food and biomass value chain we evaluated all those projects that we realized in the last couple of years and we concluded that we cant afford as a city to only look at say the physical environment or the environmental boundaries we also have to take into account the social foundation and when we met anderica again and also together with kate we decided very quickly and that uh the next step in the development of our new strategy and to really become a climate neutral and inclusive and circular city um that it is a unique opportunity to use the donuts economics framework as an underlying methodology or starting point or framework on which we can build our new strategy so what we did by developing the new fiveyear strategy and also the twoyear innovation and an action program is that we checked,positive,Youtube,,,,good afternoon to you all um<br>what we did when we developed<br>the first roadmap it  was<br>based on a research say<br>journey to find out where we<br>have to  focus on and we<br>decided back then a couple of<br>years ago to focus on the<br>build environment value chain<br>and  the food and biomass<br>value chain we evaluated all<br>those projects that we<br>realized  in the last couple<br>of years and we concluded that<br>we can't afford as a city to<br>only look  at say the physical<br>environment or the<br>environmental boundaries we<br>also have to take into account<br>the social foundation and when<br>we met anderica again and also<br>together with  kate we decided<br>very quickly and that uh the<br>next step in the  development<br>of our new strategy and to<br>really become a climate<br>neutral and inclusive  and<br>circular city um that it is a<br>unique opportunity to use the<br>donuts  economics framework as<br>an underlying methodology or<br>starting point or framework<br>on which we can build our new<br>strategy so what we did by<br>developing the new  five-year<br>strategy and also the two-year<br>innovation and an action<br>program is that we checked
204-27,,very thoroughly if every aspect every building stone of the strategy and this program is really helping us to stay within the planetary boundaries and at the same time strengthen social foundation and in your new roadmap you focused on three sectors um so you have the built environment and organic and and the food organic waste streams in the food sector and youve added consumer products as a focus area for amsterdam could you talk us through about what the donut economics framework looks like when applied to a specific sector like consumer goods or the built environment yeah what you did because we were looking at these three value chains and when we also developed together the strategy and all the the two and more hundreds of projects within the innovation and action program we did that together with all the different departments we have in our city administration so its really a citywide program and we also include other stakeholders like the businesses the citizens the knowledge institutions so its a kind of movement that we are creating throughout our city um and using the learned economic frameworks makes us realize that when we are developing our,neutral,Youtube,,,,very thoroughly if every<br>aspect every building stone of<br>the strategy and this  program<br>is really helping us to stay<br>within the planetary<br>boundaries and at the same<br>time strengthen social<br>foundation and in your new<br>roadmap you focused on  three<br>sectors um so you have the<br>built environment and organic<br>and and the food organic<br>waste streams in the food<br>sector and you've added<br>consumer products as a focus<br>area for amsterdam  could you<br>talk us through about what the<br>donut economics framework<br>looks like when applied to a<br>specific  sector like consumer<br>goods or the built environment<br>yeah what you did because we<br>we're looking at these three<br>value chains and when we also<br>developed together the<br>strategy and all the the two<br>and more hundreds of  projects<br>within the innovation and<br>action program we did that<br>together with all the<br>different departments we have<br>in our city administration so<br>it's really a city-wide<br>program and  we also include<br>other stakeholders like the<br>businesses the citizens the<br>knowledge  institutions so<br>it's a kind of movement that<br>we are creating throughout our<br>city  um and using the learned<br>economic frameworks makes us<br>realize that when we are<br>developing our
